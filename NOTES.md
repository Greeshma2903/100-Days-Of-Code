**Operator Overloading**

- Operator overloading prommoted polymorphism
- Overloading operators doesn't destroy the original meaning, precedence and grammer of operator
- In C++ we can overload operators using Mem. functions / friend functions

**Cache Memory**

- To reduce processing time, their is intermediate memory btwn Processor and Main memory, which stores the frequenty used data. 
- The processor first checks the cache for relevant data and fetch, if not present, data is loaded from Main to Cache and then fetched by processsor
- Cache size << Main memory :: faster speed and efficiency
- Memory Hierarchy
    - registers (in Processor)
    - cache (btwn CPU and Main)
    - main memory
    - disk cache
    - optical
    - magnetic tape
